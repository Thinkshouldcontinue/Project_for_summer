# Project_for_summer

This project is a about the density estimation of the random variable in stochastic differential equation.

There are two main parts:

1.density estimation parts.

2.numerical simulation of the stochastic differential equation.


For density estimation:

1.Kernel Density Estimation

2.Normalizing Flow
