# Project_for_summer

This project is a about the density estimation of the random variable in stochastic differential equation.

There are two main parts:

1.density estimation parts.

2.numerical simulation of the stochastic differential equation.


For density estimation:

1.Kernel Density Estimation

2.Normalizing Flow


Work Flow:

1.Generate data from numerical simulation of SDE

2.Estimating the density

For kernel density estimation:
I would say this is a method of estimation by the shape.
What is important is the choice of bandwidth, kernel function. For implementation, Python and R is used.

For normalizing flow:
I would say this is a method of estimation by the transformation.
this model includes neural network.
What is important is the bijector, tensorflow and pytorch are used.
